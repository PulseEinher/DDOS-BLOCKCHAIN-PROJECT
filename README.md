# 🚨 DDoS Detection & Tamper-Proof Security Logging System

A production-structured Machine Learning + API + Dashboard system for detecting DDoS attacks using flow-based traffic features, with blockchain-style integrity logging for security event auditing.

This project demonstrates applied machine learning in cybersecurity, secure API design, defensive engineering, and tamper-evident logging.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system performs:

- Flow-based DDoS classification using a trained RandomForest model  
- Real-time inference via FastAPI  
- Interactive monitoring dashboard using Streamlit  
- Blockchain-style immutable ledger logging for detected DDoS events  
- Integrity verification of logged security events  

The system simulates a security monitoring pipeline where malicious network activity is detected and securely recorded.

## 🔬 Machine Learning Component

- Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier  
- Problem Type: Binary Classification (Benign vs DDoS)  
- Dataset: CIC-DDoS2019  
- Preprocessing:
  - Removal of non-numeric columns
  - NaN and infinite value cleaning
  - Feature alignment to trained model size

The model is trained using `ml/train.py` and saved as:

```text
ml/model.joblib
```

The API loads this model at runtime with defensive error handling.

---

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### `GET /`
Returns service status message.

---

### `GET /health`

Health check endpoint.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "service": "ddos-detection-api"
}
```

---

### `POST /predict`

Performs flow classification.

Request:

```json
{
  "features": [0.0, 10.2, 5.6]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "prediction": "DDoS",
  "confidence": 0.9821,
  "features_used": 78,
  "model_decision": "statistical flow-based classification"
}
```

If a DDoS attack is detected, the event is written to the blockchain ledger.

---

### `GET /ledger`

Returns all logged DDoS events.

---

### `GET /ledger/verify`

Verifies blockchain integrity.

Ensures:

- No block tampering  
- No broken hash chain  
- Valid recalculated SHA256 hashes  

---

## 🔐 Blockchain-Style Ledger

Each detected DDoS event is stored as a block:

```json
{
  "index": 3,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-16T12:00:00",
  "prediction": "DDoS",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "previous_hash": "abc123",
  "hash": "def456"
}
```

Each block includes:

- SHA256 hash of its contents  
- Reference to previous block  
- Immutable chaining  

This ensures tamper-evident logging for security audit scenarios.
